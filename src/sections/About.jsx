                I'm a Systems Engineering student at ORT Uruguay with hands-on experience in
                production IT environments, working across operations, automation, and
                software development. I started my career in operational roles and gradually
                evolved into more technical positions, always focused on understanding how
                systems behave in real-world scenarios.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, I work as an RPA Analyst and developer, building and maintaining
                automations using C#, Selenium, and database-driven logic. I also contribute
                to the development of a proprietary low-code platform, working closely with
                databases, business logic, and functional requirements to deliver reliable,
                end-to-end solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                I enjoy acting as a bridge between technical and business teams, translating
                real needs into functional and maintainable systems. I'm especially
                interested in backend development, databases, automation, and process
                optimization, and I'm constantly learning to improve both my technical and
                analytical skills.
